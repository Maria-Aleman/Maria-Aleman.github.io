<p style="color:lime;font-size:40px;font-family:courier;text-align:center;"><b>I believe that this is the only sci fi indie horror in my recommendations, this game is filled with questions on what real purpose does the protagonist have, why mother has been acting off since your arrival, etc. The vhs presentation as well as with some glitches throughout the game play in a dim environment creates a creepy atmosphere to this game. The plot especially threw me in a loop so if my description seems quite vague it's because I really don't want to spoil much for the game because of how much I loved it. </p>
