<p style="color:lime;font-size:40px;font-family:courier;text-align:center;"><b>This is also a very well respected indie dev team when it comes to releasing good vhs filtered, old playstation graphics, survival horror games.Chilla's art is another japanese indie dev who, like Fears to Fathom, focises on a more grounded, realistic settings that take place in Japan it's game however still have supernatural elements throughout it's games. Majority of these devs' games (I think they've made over 15) are dim and dark which builds the isolated, eerie atmosphere to the games, with the exception of The Convinience Store. It does rely on jumpscares but they're not cheap jumpscares so it's okay. Their more infamous games that I definitely recommend playing ae "The Closing Shift" and "Aka Manto". </p>
